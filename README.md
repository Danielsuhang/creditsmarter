# Credit Smarter
This application helps the user pick the right credit card for him/her by using the three biggest spending categories to find the credit card with the most cashback. The application takes into account credit score and amount of credit card paid off per month (for APR) as well when determining the monthly cashback the user would get. 

It also allows the user to search through all the credit cards on file and sort them by APR, Credit Score requirements, cashback, etc.
